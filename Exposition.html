        Ender's Game takes place in an Earth where humans are in a war against the Buggers, a type of alien. Every one
        must have one child to join the battle. Each kid is observed for a few years to see if they will be a good
        soldier. Six year old Andrew (or Ender) was the best choice of three kids to join. His brother Peter was too
        destructive and his sister Valentine was too nice.
